Digital Heater Control
This repository contains PLC code for controlling a digital heater system.

Overview
The system consists of a heater, a temperature sensor, and a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). The PLC reads the digital signal from the temperature sensor and controls the heater to maintain the desired temperature.

Code
The PLC code is written in ladder logic and is compatible with different PLCs. The code is organized into the following modules:

Main Program: This module is responsible for the overall control of the system. It reads the digital signal from the temperature sensor, compares it to the desired setpoint, and controls the heater accordingly.

Heater Control: This module controls the heater based on the output from the Main Program module.

Usage
To use this code, you will need a PLC and the associated programming software for your PLC. You will also need to connect the PLC to the heater and the temperature sensor.

Once you have the hardware set up, you can download the PLC code to the PLC and run it. The code will automatically control the heater and monitor the temperature.
